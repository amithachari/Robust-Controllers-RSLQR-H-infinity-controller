# Robust-Controllers-RSLQR-H-infinity-controller
Robust Controllers Design and Comparative Analysis (RSLQR &amp; H-infinity controller) 
▪ Designed an RSLQR Controller to command acceleration (Az) for an aircraft using state feedback. The design point was identified by analyzing LQR charts, and the robustness was validated using the small gain theorem.

▪ The results were compared to those of an H-infinity state feedback controller designed with gamma iteration to control Az. Improved Gain Margin by 8.3dB and Phase Margin by 22.7 degrees with similar rise and settling time.
